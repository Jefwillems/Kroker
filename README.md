# Kroker Project

## Overview

The Kroker project is a learning initiative focused on understanding TCP communication and the Kestrel web server's `ConnectionHandler`. This project involves implementing various protocols, starting with the STOMP (Simple Text Oriented Messaging Protocol) protocol, handling connections, and processing commands in a C# application.

## Project Structure

- **Kroker.Core**: Contains the core logic for protocol handling, including frame parsing and writing.
- **Kroker.Stomp.Tests**: Contains unit tests for the STOMP frame parser and other components.

## Key Components

### Protocol Handling

The project aims to support multiple protocols, starting with the STOMP protocol. The key classes involved are:

- `StompFrame`: Represents a STOMP frame with a command, headers, and content.
- `StompFrameParser`: Parses incoming STOMP frames and writes outgoing frames.
- `StompProcessor`: Processes incoming STOMP frames and handles different STOMP commands.

### TCP Communication

The project uses TCP communication to handle connections and data transfer. This involves:

- Implementing custom connection handlers.
- Managing data buffers and parsing incoming data.
- Sending and receiving protocol frames over TCP.

### Kestrel Web Server

The project leverages the Kestrel web server's `ConnectionHandler` to manage TCP connections. This includes:

- Creating custom connection handlers to process incoming connections.
- Integrating the connection handlers with the Kestrel server.
- Handling connection lifecycle events and data transfer.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- .NET SDK
- Visual Studio or JetBrains Rider

### Building the Project

1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/Jefwillems/Kroker.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```sh
   cd kroker
   ```
3. Build the project:
   ```sh
   dotnet build
   ```

### Running the Tests

1. Navigate to the test project directory:
   ```sh
   cd Kroker.Stomp.Tests
   ```
2. Run the tests:
   ```sh
   dotnet test
   ```

## Learning Objectives

- **TCP Communication**: Understand the basics of TCP communication, including connection handling, data transfer, and buffer management.
- **Kestrel Web Server**: Learn how to use the Kestrel web server's `ConnectionHandler` to manage TCP connections.
- **Protocol Implementation**: Gain insights into implementing and handling various protocols, starting with the STOMP protocol, in a C# application.
